/**
 * Curated voice lists for the user-facing voice picker. Each provider has many more
 * options than this — these are the ones surfaced in Settings to keep the picker
 * scannable.
 *
 * The [id] is what's persisted and sent to the API. The [displayName] is shown in the
 * dropdown and is intentionally English-only for v1; if/when we localize, these move
 * to strings.xml.
 *
 * [locale] is the voice's *baked-in* accent — only meaningful for providers whose
 * voices have a fixed accent that can't be steered by prompt (ElevenLabs voice
 * clones). Null means the picker does not filter that voice by accent: Gemini's
 * prebuilt voices and OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini-tts` voices both accept a prompt-
 * side accent directive at synthesis time (Gemini reliably; OpenAI imperfectly
 * — see the per-engine notes in `geminiAccentDirectiveFor` and
 * `openAiAccentInstructionFor`). The picker only filters by [locale] when it's
 * non-null.

 * Voices with a null [TtsVoiceOption.locale] are accent-agnostic and always
 * pass the filter. [VoiceLocale.SYSTEM] disables filtering — the user has not

// ElevenLabs voice IDs are opaque strings; the human-readable name only shows in

// plan can clone their own voice — they'd need to copy/paste the voice ID by
// hand, which we don't surface in v1.
//
// Each entry is tagged with the voice's native accent — ElevenLabs voices are
// clones of specific speakers, so the accent is fixed and can't be steered by
// prompt. The Settings picker filters by the user's selected variant; if the
// filter empties out we fall back to the full list. The v1 library is entirely
// en-US, so en-GB and en-AU users see the fallback today.
